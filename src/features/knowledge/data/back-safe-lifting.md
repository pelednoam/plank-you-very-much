Lifting heavy objects, whether weights in the gym or boxes at home, requires proper technique to protect your spine.

## Key Principles:

1.  **Maintain Neutral Spine:** Keep the natural curves of your back. Avoid excessive rounding or arching.
2.  **Engage Your Core:** Brace your abdominal muscles as if expecting a punch. This stabilizes the spine.
3.  **Lift with Your Legs:** Bend at your hips and knees, not your waist. Keep the object close to your body.
4.  **Keep Head Up:** Look forward, not down, to help maintain spinal alignment.
5.  **Avoid Twisting:** Move your feet to turn; don't twist your torso while lifting or holding a heavy load.

*Remember: If it feels too heavy, get help!*
