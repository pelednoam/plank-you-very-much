Staying adequately hydrated is crucial for both cognitive function and physical performance, especially during exercise.

## Why Hydrate?

*   **Temperature Regulation:** Sweat cools the body, but depletes fluids.
*   **Nutrient Transport:** Water carries nutrients to cells and removes waste.
*   **Joint Lubrication:** Helps cushion joints.
*   **Muscle Function:** Dehydration can lead to cramps and reduced strength.

## Tips:

*   Drink water throughout the day, not just when thirsty.
*   Increase intake before, during, and after exercise.
*   Monitor urine color (pale yellow is good).
*   Consider electrolytes for long or intense workouts in the heat.
